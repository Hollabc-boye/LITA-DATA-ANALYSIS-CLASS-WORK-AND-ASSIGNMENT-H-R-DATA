### Project Overview 
---  
This project is a personnel data with comprehensive analysis and management solution for a Human Resources Data. By analysing the various dataset received, we seek to gain insight into numbers of employee and retention, employee behaviour (such as attrition, promotion and satisfaction) with their job role and performance analysis which in turn help us to analyze and visualize all employee related data such as employee demographics and other key Human Resources metrics.


### Objectives 
---
The objectives of this projects is to derive actionable insights into trends and correlations that can guide decision making and help to improve on factors influencing employee retention. Which can serve as a valuable insight/framework for decision makers, Human Resources professionals and Data Analysts to take proactive measures

- Analyze Retention trends: Identify factors contributing to employee retention or disengagement, if it's voluntary or involuntary separations
  
- Assess employee satisfaction through the data : To leverage satisfaction metrics to assess wellbeing and job satisfaction
analysis on employee feedback

- Identify areas for improvement in workplace and employee relation, enabling the development of targeted retention strategies


### Data Collected and Source
---
The Data used is the record of ex and current employee, compiled by the Human Resources (H.R), it's named LITA H R  Data.xlsx
The data is shared by one of the Incubator Hub Data Analysis facilitators and uploaded to LITA Canvass LMS where it's downloaded. It's a data with key fields such as employee demographic and other employee related fields.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short): This involved analysing and summarising of a dataset to uncover patterns, gain insights which answers some questions about the data, such as: 

What is the Total Number of Employee?

Which department has the highest attrition count? 

Which gender has the highest attrition? 

What age band (group) has the highest attrition?


### Data Collection, Cleaning and preparations
---
The following steps were taken before analysing the data

i. Loading and transforming of data 

ii. Checking and confirming the data quality (by checkung the column quality, column profile and column distribution) 

iii. Cleaning of the loaded data (by performing a promoter header due to improper heading of the loaded data) 

iv. Analysing and Formatting of the loaded data (creating of conditional columnn for attrition count and changing the data type)

### Exploratory Analysis
---
To analyze and visualize a data, various features such as employe demographics, job roles, performance and retention are needed to explore to uncover insights. Key features to explore includes:

- Total Number of Employee: The entire workforce count (both the current employees and employees who have left). This is needed to ascertain the level of retention in the organization. The Total Number of Employee according to the data is 1,470; Because this is a single value, I used a new card to visualize this report

- Department that has the highest attrition: The department with the highest attrition number from the total attrition count. This is needed to determine if the cause of attrition is departmental or not. The department with the highest number is the R and D with 133 figure out of the total number of 237 

- The gender with the highest attrition: The gender that has the highest attrition. There is need to know if the attrition is gender based or not. The dataset showed that male has more attrition than female with 150 attrition count out of 237 attrition
  
- The age band (group) with the highest attrition: This age group with the highest attrition to decide if the attrition is due to aging/retirement or other factors.

### Data Analysis 
--- 
- TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE: The entire workforce count (both the current employees and employees who have left). The Total Number of Employee according to the data is 1,470 - (Male = 882, female = 588)
  
- TOTAL NUMBER OF ATTRITION COUNT: The total number of attrition. That is, employeees who have left the organization during this period and the figure is 237 - (Male = 150, Female = 87)
  
- TOTAL NUMBER OF CURRENT EMPLOYEE: The count of employees actively working at the period is 1,233 - (Male = 732, Female = 501)
  
- THE ATTRITION RATE: This shows the percentage of employee who has left the workforce is 16%  - (Male = 17%, Female = 15%)
  
- AVERAGE AGE: It shows the average age distribution of the entire workforce as 37

- ATTRITION COUNT BY DEPARTMENT: It shows the number of employees of different department who have left the workforce within the period. 
  i. R and D top the list with 90 Male and 43 Female, Total = 133
  
  ii. Sales Dept has 54 Male and 38 Female, Total = 92

### Conclusion 
---
1. Retention Trend: The analysis shows a notable portion of employees are leaving the workforce. 

Solution: A retention strategy such as, good employee engagement, regular survey or checks to understand employee satisfaction and concern need to be introduced or strengthened in a place where such is in existence. can help mitigate the risk of attrition before it happens  


2. Employee satisfaction and job role: The data showed a higher figure/rank of very dissatisfied than very satisfied in the employee job roles. The dissatisfaction could be with role expectations, or compensation. 

Solution: An introduction of clear job role, improved benefits and competitive compensation packages could be an effective retention startategy in this regard. 


3. Attrition by department analysis: It was found that R and D department face higher turnover rates.

Solution: There is need for further investigation to identify departmental issues, such as their workload, leadership, that may be contributing to employee departures


4. Attrition based on Gender: It was noticed that in all the analysis carried out, male has the highest attrition in all the records; From departmental, marital status, educational field, age band and other metrics

Solution: Majority of male likes to balance family life, experience career advancement, have a good mentorship or role models, have a challenged career goals. They might seek employment elsewhere, where the above and more is available 


### Recommendations
---
- Career development: Offering career growth opportunities could encourage employee to stay longer and perform at their best.  
- Competitive compensation: Regular review and adjustment of salary structure which ensure fairly compensation relative to their roles, experience and industry standard can help mitigate the risk of attrition before it happens.  
- Enable the development of targeted retention strategies.

Generally, attrition is a multiple contributing factors. The data provides actionable insights that can guide human resources professionals in developing targetd strategies to improve employee retention. By addresssing the identified issues, organizations can reduce turnover, enhance employee satisfaction, and foster a more engaged and loyal workforce.👏 🙇‍♀️
