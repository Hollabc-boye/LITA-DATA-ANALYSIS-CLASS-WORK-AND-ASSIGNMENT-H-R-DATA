### Project Overview 
---  
This project is about a comprehensive analysis and management solution for a Human Resources Data. By analysing the various datasets received, we seek to gain insight into numbers of employee and retention, employee behaviour (such as attrition, promotion and satisfaction) with their job role and performance analysis which in turn help us to analyze and visualize all employee related data such as employee demographics and other key Human Resources metrics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as: 

What is the Total Number of Employee?: The entire workforce count (both the current employees and those who have left) is 1,470; I used a new card to visualize this 

Which department has the highest attrition count?: The department that has the highest number from the total number of employeees who have left the organization during this period is R and D with 133 figure out of 237 total



### Data Analysis 
 --- 
- TOTAL NUMBER OF ATTRITION COUNT: The total number of employeees who have left the organization during this period is 237. A new card is used for this visualization
- TOTAL NUMBER OF CURRENT EMPLOYEE: The count of employees actively working at the period is 1,233
- THE ATTRITION RATE: This shows the percentage of employee who has left the workforce is 16% 
- AVERAGE AGE: It shows the age distribution of the entire workforce as 37
- ATTRITION COUNT BY DEPARTMENT: It shows the number of employees of different department who have left the workforce within the period. Sarcastically, Human Resources department that manages recruiting is also experiencing attrition ðŸ˜„
- ATTRITION COUNT BY EDUCATIONAL FIELD: Number of employees of each educational field who left the workfore within the period 
- ATTRITION COUNT BY GENDER: The number of employees by gender who have left the workforce. This shows more male has left the workforce
- ATTRITION COUNT BY AGE BAND: Categorizing the employee who have left the workforce into age ranges with employees within 25-34 having the highest figure of 112 and over 55 having the lowest of 11
- CURRENT EMPLOYEE BY MARITAL STATUS AND GENDER: The different demographic groups who are still actively working
- ATTRITION BASED ON CURRENT EMPLOYEE, MARITAL STATUS AND GENDER: The employee who left the workforce under this categories
- ATTRITION BASED ON JOB ROLE AND JOB SATISFACTION: The employee who left workforce based on their job role and satisfaction
- ATTRITION BASED ON JOB SATISFACTION AND EDUCATIONAL FIELD: The employee of a different educational field who left workforce based on their job satisfaction
- JOB ROLE SLICER: The filtering of the data based on job roles
- ATTRITION BASED ON AGE GROUP AND GENDER: The different demographic groups who have left the workforce with 35-44 age band topping the list on both gender

 ### Conclusion 
 ---
The total number of current employee is 1,233 with 732 male and 501 female. Also, the total attrition rate of male is 17%

The top ten Stores by Revenue shows a thriving trend by Revenue generated within the period. The company can introduce incentives, bonus or promotion to the staffs of the Stores or discount when purchasing the product as an encouragement to do more. 

The Service Plan Line of Business shows a strong thriving trend above others. The company should try all within their means to keep the trend upward by focusing more on marketing strategies. This can be achieved by maintaining the product's quality/standard, customer engagement, seasonal promo and so on.
